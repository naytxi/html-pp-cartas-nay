<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>

<p>Dear Eileen,
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part<br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br></p>

<h3>Starting dates</h3><br>

<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
<li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
You can find more information <a href="https://www.ejemplo.com">about important university dates</a> on our website.<br></p>

<h3>Subject of study</h3>

<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:<br></p>

<ol>
<li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>

<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br></p>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br></p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
<blockquote> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around<br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.<br></blockquote>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
<blockquote>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> modem styles such as Twerking.<br></blockquote>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
<blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.<br></blockquote>

Yours sincerely.<br><br><br><br>
